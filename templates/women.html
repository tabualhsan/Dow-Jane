    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
 
    <p> 
        The Dow Jane is inspired to educate individuals about the stock market. As the creator for this site growing up as a woman, I was always told to save my money incase I needed it one day and never to invest it into the stock market because it is such a ‘risky move' for a woman to invest her money in stocks. Many questions started to float around in my mind; “Is it because we get paid lower?”, “Do women not take financial risks?”, “Do I have to be certified?. As I started hearing noises around the office and personal life about “What stocks have invested in?”. Then it clicked, it is just the exposure, self-taught education is such a powerful tool so why not educate me on this “secret space”.  As I did my research, I found out that women currently only hold 6% of CEO positions at S&P 500 companies. This is alarming as well, so why not create an educational platform that highlights aspects of a company to look into prior to investing in them, I have also highlighted which companies hold a women CEO to also raise awareness that the numbers are low and more women need to hold these positions and inspire more women to invest in each other.

    <h3>Facts about women business leaders</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
       <h4><strong>Women start 1,821 businesses a day</strong></h4>
        <p> — Research from American Express shows the rapid pace at which women establish businesses in the United States. Last year, female entrepreneurs employed 9.2 million people.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>Women entrepreneurs are happier</strong></h4>
        <p> — Women entrepreneurs are reportedly the happiest group of entrepreneurs in America, outranking their male counterparts, according to a study by Babson. This same study found these women are nearly three times more likely to report as happier than women who had not established their own businesses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>They find success in U.S. cities </strong></h4>
        <p>— The United States houses three out of the five top-ranked cities where female entrepreneurs can flourish. New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Boston are cities that attract and nurture women-owned businesses. We’re excited to see this trend continuing with more support for women business leaders across the country. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>About 17% of startups have a female founder</strong></h4>
        <p> — The number of venture-funded companies with women at the helm has increased in the last 10 years. Currently, the data shows that these women-led companies are hovering around approximately 17% of the market.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>Companies prosper with women leaders</strong></h4>
        <p> — When companies have women in leadership positions, they often have higher stock returns and greater profits. It’s surprising then that only 5% of CEOs are women. Women are more successful in these roles because they view their careers holistically, approaching work in a self-reflective manner.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>Women-run companies perform better on the S&P 500 </strong></h4>
        <p>— In fact, these companies perform three times better, garnering more returns than their male compatriots. It’s speculated that women do so well because of how hard they had to work early on in their careers to become CEO. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4><strong>Women are rated as better leaders</strong></h4>
        <p> — A Harvard University study found that women out performed men on leadership indictors, everything from taking initiative to driving for results. Interestingly, women scored higher in categories that were not traditionally thought of as female traits.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4><strong>Women-owned firms rake in millions in revenue</strong></h4>
        <p>— In the last decade, the number of women-owned companies that have amassed $10 million or more in revenues has increased by nearly 60 percent. </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>They feel better about work-life balance</strong></h4>
        <p>— It can be challenging for anyone to achieve a work-life balance, but women business leaders report that they have a healthy balance between their professional and home lives. They describe their typical week as being worthwhile and satisfying. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><strong>Women entrepreneurs have less access to capital</strong></h4>
        <p>— Women entrepreneurs still raise less money than men to jump start their businesses. Men are twice as likely as women to raise at least $100,000 or more, according to a global survey of more than 3,000 business leaders. </p>
